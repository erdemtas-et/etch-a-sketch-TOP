# ETCH-A SKETCH Project

Hello, this is another JS project I have done for The Odin Project program. It was so entertaining to make this application because I had so weird bug in my code.
After I have solved it, I wanted to add here. It can be useful for everyone.

However, the game is simple that you need to mouseover on the grid and it starts to paint the grid objects with selected color(black is default).
